# ReactArt Authentication App

This project is a simple React application featuring an authentication form with styled components. The application includes a custom `Header` component and an `AuthInputs` component for handling user authentication.

## Project Structure

The project structure is organized as follows:

- `src/components/AuthInputs.jsx`: Component responsible for rendering the authentication form with email and password inputs, validation logic, and styled buttons.
- `src/components/Header.jsx`: Custom header component displaying a logo, project name, and a brief description.
- `src/components/Input.jsx`: Custom input component used within `AuthInputs.jsx` for styling input fields.
- `src/assets/logo.png`: Project logo.
- `src/App.jsx`: Main application file combining the `Header` and `AuthInputs` components.
- `README.md`: Documentation providing an overview of the project.

## Components

### AuthInputs Component

The `AuthInputs` component represents the authentication form with email and password inputs. It includes validation logic and styled components for a clean and modern look.

### Header Component

The `Header` component displays a logo, project name, and a brief description. It utilizes styled components for responsive and visually appealing design.

### Input Component

The `Input` component is a custom-styled input field used within the `AuthInputs` component. It provides a consistent and visually pleasing input design.

## Styling

Styled components are used for styling, providing a modular and maintainable approach to styling React components. CSS properties are defined within the styled components, offering a clean and readable styling solution.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
